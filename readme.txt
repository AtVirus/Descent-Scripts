Project is a copy from old arcemu project script / sun++ scripts / moon++ scripts. Fork was created at around rev 700 ? Most credit goes to those who deserve it.

There are no major modifications made.

Only Windows is supported.

Unzip "Trunk\bin\debug\arcemu-world.zip"

Use Visual Studio 2008. Open "scripts/scripts2008.sln" + "sun++/scripts2008.sln"

Compile in "Win32-debug" or "R64-release" mode

There are disabled script. With a reason.

My personal opinion is that some of the c++ scripts are horribly written and are a manace to your server. There are times when they represent 80% of crash situations
Lua scripts will give constant server console errors
PHP scripts are simply a gathering of junk script. 99.9% they are not even worth reading.

If you want quick and simple mob AI, use the DB table "ai_agents"

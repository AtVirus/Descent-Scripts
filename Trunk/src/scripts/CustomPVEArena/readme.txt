melee needs an advantage of : ( shoot radius / move speed * DPS ) + weapon delay /
game modes should concentrate on the pace of the game : how much time do you expect people do die. How much time do you expect the match to end. Rebalance items or HP based on these settings
damage multipliers : number of autocast items * item damage * speed of autocast items
maxing a spec should be better then maxing multiple specs

statistics needed :
- how much time it needs to build structures
- what order people build structures
- what items people buy
- what items people sell
- how much time a specific build kills another build
